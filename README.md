# 3nergizer

This project was developed by me and my college squad, for the Coding Mobile discipline

3nergize is an app that allows you to calculate the daily, weekly and monthly expenses of the KWh consumed during a certain period.

An app not only capable of measuring energy costs, but also informing how these costs are distributed, from energy generation to the taxes that are levied
